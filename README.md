**VEHICLE ROUTING AND SCHEDULING OF CONTINUOUS  AMBULATORY PERITONEAL DIALYSIS (CAPD) SOLUTION:**

One of the most challenging issues to resolve in a real-world setting is vehicle routing and scheduling. Numerous industries, including the food supply chain, the delivery of raw materials to companies, Uber, healthcare, the automotive industry, and others, use VRSP. The objective of this project is to set up a network of vehicles for scheduling and distributing Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) products throughout the province of Ontario. The project's main goals are to shorten patient wait times and lower operating costs. A vehicle routing and scheduling model with a time window and capacity is taken into consideration to prevent delays in the delivery of the CAPD fluids. Additionally, the vehicles' optimal path is chosen so that it meets the demands of the patients. Using Google Maps, the warehouse (single depot) and the numerous patient locations are recorded in the Ontario region. Using the Google API, the distance matrix is produced in Python. The optimisation model is then generated in Excel and solved using the Gurobi Open solver. Additionally, a series of experiments are conducted to determine how operational costs vary by altering time windows, capacity limits, and patient demand according to their severity. The models are run, and the outputs are analysed. This algorithm aids in identifying the efficient route and thereby decreases the overall transportation cost.
